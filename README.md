# NewDale - Gigabit
 Check out our discord server <a href="https://newdale.net/discord">Here!</a> 

This is the discord bot for the NewDale network, we use it to do some stuff on it :). And yes I was to lazy to code something myself and used a drag-and-drop builder /ᐠ - ˕ -マ Ⳋ
And yes that drag and drop builder costs money too...

<h3><b>2.How can i use this?</b></h3>
Download the files. If you have discord bot maker (from steam), you can just import the project and modify it right away. If you don't then you need to change the Client ID and Bot token manually. They are stored in ~/data/settings.json


<h3>Have fun using this! </h3>
